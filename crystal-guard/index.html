            <p>
                This is a game which my group and I created in my final game design subject at university.
                <br> We worked on it over the course of a semester (about 11 weeks) and presented it to our class, teachers, and a few guests from War Gaming.
                <br> The Crystal Guard is a multiplayer, fps, tower-defence computer game made for PC and Mac platforms. My group chose this genre mashup as we we're passionate about making a game which we would enjoy playing and which had not already
                been overly done. I have placed some pictures below to help you get a better idea of the end-result.
                <br>We made a <a href="#tutorial">tutorial</a> for the game so that players could begin playing without our guidance. I worked on the networking, <a href="#pathfinding-and-grid">the grid for pathfinding and tower placement</a>,
                <a href="#responsive-pathfinding">enemy AI</a>, and <a href="#responsive-pathfinding">tower placement</a>.

                                Here you can see the beginning of the tutorial for The Crystal Guard.
                                <br> As you complete set actions the tutorial will progress until you have a grasp on the controls and concept of the game.

                                In this image you can see the debugged grid on which enemy AI pathfinds and player place towers.
                                <br> The red cubes are where enemies cannot go (unwalkable), yellow cubes are cubes that are adjactend to unwalkable cubes.
                                <br> The black line shows the path that ground units are planning to take and the pink line shows the path that air units will take.
                                <br> Pathfinding is done using a variation on a* pathfinding.

                                <h4>Responsive pathfinding</h4>
                                This picture shows what happens to enemy pathfinding when towers block their fastest route to their end goal (the crystal).
                                <br> The player has placed two towers in such a way that ground enemies have no room to get through that way so they have to pathfind around a longer way.
                                <br> This gives the player longer to kill them and if the player wants, they could lead enemies into a "killzone" with many more turrets.
                                <br> Also shown in the picture is the air enemy path which is unchanged as they can just fly over the player's towers.

                                <h4>Tower Placement</h4>
                                Here you can see the player looking at the ground to choose where to put their next tower.
                                <br> The player is placing an electric type of tower which shocks all enemies inside its radius at a constant rate.
                                <br> This tower is good because it causes damage to all enemies within its range.
                                <br> The other tower types are "Trigun" which is a minigun type tower, and "Plasma Cannon" which is a slow firing, splash damage, projectile tower.
